<p>
	Our website has been redesigned to welcome our international clients. They benefit of English content, to help them understand our activities.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot more !
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The content entends with news of our company, formerly on the blog.</li>
	<li>You can subscribe to an RSS Feed.</li>
	<li>A Search bar helps you find content.</li>
	<li>SEO has been improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<img src="/resources/images/content/logo-jekyll.png" alt="Logo de Jekyll" class="float-end" />
	Formerly in pure HTML, this website runs on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Everything here is static. It's part a challenge for me, part a will to save resources dynamic languages spill.
</p>

<p>
	The most penetrating will guess I don't spend these efforts for a post once a year. My blog articles will migrate there in a first time. My academical watch will follow. Il want to get rid of Wordpress, which was maybe a good CRM at its beginning, but is now obese.

	Please subscribe to the RSS Feed, in your preferres language. This website will soon become my main publishing channel.
